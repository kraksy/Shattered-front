# scavenger economy

- [[Rusty Nails]]

**comment**: i had this idea where the rust crackheads could salvage parts from destroyed mechs,tanks etc. and use it to their advantage.
## overview

- rusty nails units can scavenge parts from destroyed enemy mechs.

## how it should work:

1. when an enemy mech is destroyed, place a salvage token(random example) on its location.
2. nearby rusty nails units can pick up tokens.
3. spend tokens for temporary buffs:
   - +1 Damage
   - +1 Armor
   - Repair 1 HP

## Optional Rule:

- salvage tokens expire if not picked up within 2 rounds.

# Fog of War

**comment**: could be a nice addition 

## overview

- units outside line of sight remain hidden from the opponent.

## how it should works:

1. line of sight is determined by unit positioning and terrain.
2. hidden units are marked with a hidden token.
3. units with "recon" abilities can reveal hidden units.

## abilities example:

- **recon drone:** reveal all hidden units within a 20cm radius.

## advantages:

- encourages scouting and careful movement.
- enhances strategic depth.

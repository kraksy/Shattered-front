# overclocking mechanic

- [[Unity]]

**comment**: i had this idea where unity mfs could use overclock with a specific cooldown
## overview

- unity mechs can overclock their systems for temporary boosts.

## how it should work:

1. activate "overclock" during your turn.
2. choose one bonus:
   - +1 Movement
   - +1 Attack
   - gain an extra action
3. take 1 structural damage after overclocking.

## strategic Tip:

- use Overclock strategically to secure objectives or deal finishing blows.

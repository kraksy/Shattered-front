# Fog of War

## overview

- units outside line of sight remain hidden from the opponents units , and cannot be attacked.

## how it should works:

1. line of sight is determined by unit positioning and terrain.
2. units with "recon" abilities can reveal hidden units even if they are behind terrain.

## abilities example:

- **[[recon drone]]:** reveal all hidden units within a 20cm radius.

## advantages:

- encourages scouting and careful movement.
- enhances strategic depth.

# Move System

## overview

the move system is a simple system of calculations to get how much a unit can move, heavier units with weapons or armor that makes them heavy will have modifiers that makes them slower to move, or if there is any tiles that can debuff the specific unit.

## moving turn

1. **pick an unit**: choose only one unit to move.
2. **check MV:** check how much an unit can move.
3. **check modifiers**: unit modifiers have the modifiers already calculated in their MV, but its better to check if the unit is standing in pond or any water.
4. **move!**: move your unit directly where you want distance you can.

### example:

- you have a heavy unit that can only move 5 MP , 5 MP = 5 cm. if he is not standing in any debuffing land he can move any direction 5 cm.

# Random Events


**comment**: this corresponds to status effects
## overview

- introduce random battlefield events for variety and chaos.

## how it should work:

1. at the start of every second round, draw an event card.
2. apply its effect immediately.

## examples:

- **acid rain:** all units take 1 acid damage this round.
- **emp pulse:** disable all electronic abilities for one round.

## implementation:

- create a deck of 20 event cards.
- shuffle and draw randomly.

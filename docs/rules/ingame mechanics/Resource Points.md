- this basically servers as a economy system in a sense

## how it should work:

1. earn RP for:
   - holding objectives
   - destroying enemy units

2. spend RP on:
   - [[reinforcements]]
   - abilities

## optional rules:

- unused RP expires at the end of the game.
- if used in some sort of campaign they can be saved.

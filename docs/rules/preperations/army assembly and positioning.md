# army assembly and positioning

army should consist units from [[Factions]] but if any other used that is also okay if there is lore context behind. (or just have fun)
 
for example: [[Rusty Nails]] stole machines from [[Unity]]
and now using them to defeat temples of [[Unity]].

and in that context or any other to keep the fun element.

armies usually have one general or to be more specific small armies with [[army size + point]] limitations 

if army has 250 points , and I can say some general unit has cost 100, its kinda pointless to have 2 generals and have firepower difference to your enemy

# positions 

when you picked you army size , and units 
its time to place on the [[map]] .. if you don't have map check out [[map creation]] 

player can freely place units on his side

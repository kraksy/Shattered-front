# army size

2 or group of players will decide big of a army should be played 

there no limit of how much units can be used to play

if you are unsure of how big of armies to play
you can choose of these three army size presets that are balanced for base game of shattered front

```
	small army - 600 points
	medium army - 1200 points
	large army - 1200+ points
```

small army is really the smallest you can go in terms of size of the units 

but it should be optimal 

medium army is way to go , and anything above that is just about how much fun do you want
# unit point values

unit values are really important to balance the game play as much as you can , or more of make fun things playable still but not so the other person can have the same fun

if you want to add any new units these are general value sizes to refer to 

```
	average small unit point value : 1-10
	large unit point value (leaders) : 100-120
	medium unit point value (only single) : 90-100
```

# Lore Codex I

# timeline
- ![[pre-Mechanical stage]]
- [[world wars]]
- [[land division]]






planet rich in raw materials , minerals gasses and others

people of this planet lived peaceful life very close to our life till showers of meteorites landed on the surface and gave the mankind [[ignite]]

that literally ignited the war between people in chaos that never ended. till now times

[[ignite]] is very flammable and gravity defining 

red material that is cleaner or more dirty dependable on how people use it

when burned directly, secondary product is heavy smoke that fill the lungs of one very quickly and kills after more then one puffs from such smoke 

but more sophisticated factions use cleaner ways


where multiple factions battle for land , or they just fight for status 
before all the fighting and chaos
